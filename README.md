## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of Netflixâ€™s content library using Power BI. The goal was to derive meaningful insights about the types, durations, ratings, and release patterns of the content available on Netflix. 

Over 7,600 records from the Netflix dataset were analyzed and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The analysis focused on the following areas:

- **Content Type Analysis:** Compared the number of Movies vs. TV Shows available on the platform, revealing that Movies account for nearly 70% of the total titles.
- **Content Rating Distribution:** Visualized the most common content ratings like TV-MA, TV-14, and TV-PG, offering insight into the platformâ€™s target audiences.
- **Release Year Trends:** Tracked the number of content releases by year, showing a peak in content additions between 2018 and 2020.
- **Duration Breakdown:** Analyzed movie durations (e.g., 1.5â€“2 hours) and categorized TV shows into series length (short, medium, long).
- **Top Directors:** Identified the most prolific directors for both Movies and TV Shows on Netflix.
- **Country-Specific Insights:** Highlighted countries with the most content, including a notable presence of over 950 Indian movies.

The visuals and summaries were compiled into a clean, presentation-ready PDF report, suitable for stakeholder communication or portfolio showcasing. All data transformations and visualizations were handled within Power BI using DAX and Power Query Editor.
